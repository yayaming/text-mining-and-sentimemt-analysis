People passed on their thought and emotion from generation to generation through lyrics of songs, and both laughed at it and cried to it. Lyrics present us with an artist’s perspective of life, society, or world. Not only the melody but also the lyrics carry the mood of the times. That’s why I want to do the text mining and sentiment analysis of song lyrics.

In my project, there are the English songs in 1980 to 2023. I attempted to analyze the unique characteristics of song lyrics. First, I examined some descriptive statistics about the database, then took a closer look at the lyrics thoughts the decades or different music type, also applied sentiment analysis to them. Next, tried to examine closer the importance of words, by the decades, the types, or specific artists. Finally, performed topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).
